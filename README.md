# Plant Disease Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection project! This project aims to revolutionize the way farmers diagnose and treat plant diseases by harnessing the power of deep learning.

## Overview

In agriculture, identifying plant diseases early is crucial for preventing crop loss and ensuring food security. With this in mind, we've developed a sophisticated system that allows farmers to effortlessly diagnose diseases affecting their crops. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our model can accurately classify diseases based on images of plant leaves.

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Farmers can easily navigate to the respective "Potato clinic" or "Bellpeper clinic" folders, depending on the type of plant they need diagnosed.
- **Efficient Diagnosis**: By simply inserting an image of a leaf, our model swiftly identifies the disease plaguing the plant, enabling prompt treatment.
- **Accurate Classification**: Leveraging the power of CNNs, our model achieves high accuracy in disease classification, reducing misdiagnoses and ensuring effective treatment plans.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with farmers in mind, our system prioritizes simplicity and accessibility, empowering users with the tools they need to protect their crops.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the "Potato clinic" or "Bellpeper clinic" folder, depending on the type of plant you need diagnosed.
2. Insert an image of the affected leaf into the designated folder.
3. Run the provided script to initiate the disease classification process.
4. Receive prompt results indicating the identified disease.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

To get started with the Plant Disease Detection system, simply clone this repository and ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Follow the instructions provided in the respective "Potato clinic" or "Bellpeper clinic" folder to initiate the diagnosis process.
